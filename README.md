# lto-candidate-testing-ansible

This is the git repository lto-candidate-testing-ansible.

It is designed to test your understanding of the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) tool.

You should reference the Ansible [modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html) documentation frequently, 
particularly the [Cloud modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html).

You should find everything you need to complete this test in this README.md.

## How to complete this test

This test is comprised of three tasks.  For each task make your changes, commit them and finally push your changes to the git remote.  If you're not 
sure how to do this don't worry!  Each git command will be shown below.

We encourage you to thoroughly explore everything in each branch.  Make changes where-ever you feel appropriate.  We're interested in the changes you
make that you are not explicitly asked to make for example, documentation (hint! hint!).

Don't be afraid to leave comments all over the place to explain why you have chosen to do things in a particular way.

1. Clone this repository using the instructions in Bitbucket
2. Read the file 'INSTRUCTIONS.md'
3. After making your changes, commit them `git add -A && git commit -m "My commit"`. You can make as many commits as you like. Use appropriate git
messages.
4. Push your changes to the origin `git push`
